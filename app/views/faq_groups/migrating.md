# I have an existing product, can I put it on Assembly?

Yes. You can take any product you've already started building, launched, or is even profitable to Assembly

# How do prepare my existing product for Assembly?

Assembly manages all domains in escrow on behalf of the contributors and core team. Additionally collects the revenue and distributes proceeds to all the contributors. Before an existing product can be built on Assembly, its important that the code base is released under the AGPL license and the domain and revenue collection is transferred for management to Assembly. 

# How do I transfer my domain?

[Contact us](mailto:support@assembly.com) and we'll help you get started. Assembly will release your domain back to the original owner at anytime requested prior to accepting contributions from Assembly contributors. If a product has accepted contributions from the Assembly community then reclaiming the domain requires unanimous consent from the Core Team, Assembly and a notice to the community with proper time for feedback.

# I already have a repo with code, what do I do?

Assembly provides a free public GitHub repo for every product. If you already have source code elsewhere, push it up to the GitHub repo Assembly has provisioned for your product. You'll also need to update the license to AGPL.

# What do I do about hosting my new product?

Continue to host the product in the same way your used to. Report any monthly expenses to your product's financials so the community can reimburse those costs from the future profit.
