# What does it mean to watch a product?

If you are watching a product, you’ll receive occasional emails with updates from the team.


# What does it mean to join a team?

If you join a team, you’ll receive notifications (both on the web and occasionally via email) when people are discussing the product or creating new bounties and projects on it.

If you want to help build a product, start by joining the team and introducing yourself.


# Can I create a bounty for a product if I’m not on the Core Team?

Yes. If you haven’t worked on the product much, it may be best to check in with the Core Team in chat and make sure priorities are aligned, but anyone can create a bounty.

However, only the Core Team can award a bounty.


# Where can I request features for Assembly?

You can [submit a bounty](assembly.com/meta/wips), or you can [hop into our chat](assembly.com/meta/chat) and let us know.
