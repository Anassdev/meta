#Coins on the Blockchain

Assembly has put its <a href="">App Coins</a> on the Blockchain.  Products that have been greenlit, or are profitable, have their ownership distributions inscribed on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

App Coins on the Blockchain exist as 'Colored Coins'.  This means they are digital assets written in on top of Bitcoin.  There is a protocol, called 'Open Assets', which is a meta-layer on top of Bitcoin, allowing tokens to be abstracted out of trace amounts of Bitcoin.  These colored coins inherit the properties of Bitcoin in that they are cryptographically secure, completely trustless, and easy to transfer.  

App Coins on the Blockchain are written in trace amounts of Bitcoin, but their value does not stem from the bitcoins that compose them.  It's like taking a penny and writing a message on it, "This is one share of Apple."  The penny itself would be meaningless; the ownership it represents is what matters.  In the case of Colored Coins, the entire process of labelling bitcoins is ineffaceable; what has been written cannot be unwritten.  

It is possible to transfer these tokens as well as issue new ones.  Anyone may do so with the API server Assembly has built, called AssemblyCoins.  Tokens can be created to represent anything one wishes; the original issuer alone controls the total supply.  

However the colored coins created to represent Assembly App Coins are subject to certain restrictions, outside of the underlying protocol.  Because App Coins confer ownership rights on real world property and revenue streams, they are subject to certain <a href="#">legal restrictions</a>.  In order to comply with SEC regulations, among others, we currently do not allow users to transfer or sell their app coins.  Hopefully, if the laws change, this will become possible.  We would like nothing more than for an open market to exist for Assembly App Coins.  However the law must catch up first.
