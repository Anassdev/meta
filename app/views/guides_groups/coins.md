#Coins

Product ownership is represented by App Coins.  Each product has its own coin.  Users
earn ownership by completing tasks such as bounties or receiving tips which award coins.
At any time, you can view the coin distribution for a given product under the '/partners'
ownership page for a product.  Similarly, each user can see his coins among the products has has
contributed to on the profile page.

Coins come in several forms.  Each product has its own coin.  A new product is initialized with 10 million
unvested coins.  An unvested coin is a coin that has been created and is held by the product itself, ie not by a person.  It has not yet been allocated to a user.  Thus it does not play a part in the relative percentage
ownership commanded by users.  

Coins awarded to users immediately become 'vested' coins.  These coins are fully in play and give full ownership
rights.  Unvested coins become vested upon the awarding of a bounty.  Vested coins must come out of the
available pool of unvested coins.

We introduced vested vs unvested coins to introduce predictability in the total supply of coins for a product.
Coins can only be awarded to users if they already existed as unvested coins.  The unvested coin number can be
increased by a majority vote of product owners.  But an increase in the coin supply, aka, a dilution of current owners, should be a major decision made with maximal community input.  

If you are an owner, you can rest assured that your coins can only be diluted in a controlled, predictable process.  Coins cannot be created endlessly through bounties you might not keep track of.  Expansion of the coin supply is a comparatively rare event in which your feedback will be solicited.  This is a measure to protect owners; particularly if a product is exceptionally valuable in financial terms, we want to maximally protect stakeholders from unexpected, unpredictable dilution.

For all practical purposes, such as the allocation of revenue, or exercising product governance rights, a user's ownership is calculated as his percentage of vested coins, not the total number of coins.  So, for example, if a product has 10,000,000 total coins, but only 4,000,000 are vested, a user with 1,000,000 coins effectively owns 25% of the product.  He will receive 25% of profits and have a 25% say in governance-related decisions.  Only vested coins count towards profit disbursements and product management decisions.
