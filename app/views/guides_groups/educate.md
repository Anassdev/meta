#How do I educate people about my product?

One of the biggest challenges to managing a product is keeping
the community up-to-date on latest happenings.  This comes in
several forms.

On a technical level, it is always best to have
an onboarding process to educate new users about the workings
of the product.  Whatever has been built already, how does it work?
What is the technical structure of the app that has been built
(or will be built)?  A technical onboarding guide, if even a
short one, can dramatically simplify the process of bringing new
potential contributors up to speed.

It's also important to <a href="">market</a> your product to
maintain awareness.  If no one knows about your product, then
no one can help build it!  Here are a few things you can do
to promote a product

- Write posts describing product milestones
- Write detailed, precise bounties
- Stay active in community and product chat
- Keep the Product overview up-to-date.  Be expressive!  This is
where curious new users will chance upon your product.
