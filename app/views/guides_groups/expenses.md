#Handling Expenses

It is possible to log business-related expenses for a product.

These should only constitute strictly business-relevant activities related to maximizing value for owners.  

Expenses, once reported, are not guaranteed to be honored if they appear to be fraudulent or abusive.  

The best way to have your expenses compensated:

- Make expenses business-crucial, things like:
  - hosting/server costs
  - paying for apps required by the business
  - marketing, advertising costs
  - hiring outside contractors

- Upload a receipt of the expense.  It is essential to provide some sort of documentation that the expense was legitimate.  This dramatically improves the probability that the expense will be approved by Assembly (and others working on the product).

Assembly's aim is to maximize the success of products by allowing users to expense things.  Accordingly, Assembly demands a high standard of documentation in the interests of maximizing value delivered to owners.
