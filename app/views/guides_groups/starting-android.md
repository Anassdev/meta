# Starting a New Android app

#### Writing code
You do not need a Google Play subscription to write an Android app.

Assembly makes it easy for you to distribute your app so that you do not have to pay for a developer program subscription with Google. Assembly will publish the app, manage expenses, and distribute revenue to you and your contributors.

#### Source code
Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code for your app to this repository. Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you have problems accessing your repository.

#### App Distribution
When you are ready to submit your app to the Google Play store for distribution, send an email to assembly@helpful.io with your product name, a link to your source code repositories, and the email address you would like to use to login to the Google Play Developer Console.

#### Monetization and In-App purchases
Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you are planning to add in-app purchases or use ad SDKs to monetize your app.

#### Domains
Assembly holds domains on behalf of the respective products to which they belong. All products on Assembly must transfer ownership of their domains within 90 days of joining the platform. Products that have not transfered their domains within this time frame will be removed from the platform.

If you already own a domain that you would like to use with your Assembly product, unlock your domain at your registrar and email assembly@helpful.io with an authorization code to initialize the transfer.

If you do not have a domain and would like to purchase one, email assembly@helpful.io. Include the name of your Assembly product, the desired domain name, and a link to the Github repository for your product.
