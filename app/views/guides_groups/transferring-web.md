# Transferring a Web App

#### Source code
Each Assembly product has an associated Github repo under the [asm-products organization](https://github.com/asm-products/). Your product repo will be located at `github.com/asm-products/PRODUCTSLUG`. Please push the source code for your app to this repository. Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you have problems accessing your repository.

Make sure to remove sensitive info like private configuration keys and passwords.

#### Hosting
Assembly generally can cover hosting costs if your app is hosted on Heroku. Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if you need a Heroku app created on your behalf or if you have an existing Heroku app that you need to transfer. Assembly requires ownership of the Heroku app so that we can track expenses and pay for hosting.

#### SSL
If you require a SSL certificate for your service, send an email to assembly@helpful.io.

#### Accepting Payments
Send an email to assembly@helpful.io if your product is already accepting revenue.

If you are not accepting payments yet, but would like to, you should use Assembly Payments. Assembly Payments is a proxy through Stripe that allows your product to collect revenue from customers. Using Assembly payments makes it easy for Assembly to distribute revenue to you and contributors on your product. Assembly will issue US citizens a 1099 if their share of the revenue exceeds a certain threshold as specified by the IRS.

Check out the [Assembly payments repo](https://github.com/asm-products/payments
) and README for instructions on how to integrate Assembly payments with your app. https://github.com/asm-products/payments


#### Domains
Assembly holds domains on behalf of the respective products to which they belong. All products on Assembly must transfer ownership of their domains within 90 days of joining the platform. Products that have not transfered their domains within this time frame will be removed from the platform.

If you already own a domain that you would like to use with your Assembly product, unlock your domain at your registrar and email assembly@helpful.io with an authorization code to initialize the transfer.

If you do not have a domain and would like to purchase one, email assembly@helpful.io. Include the name of your Assembly product, the desired domain name, and a link to the Github repository for your product.
