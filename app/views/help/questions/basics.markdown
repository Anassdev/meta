title: How does Assembly work?
---

Assembly enables profitable products to be built like open source projects. The projects are open and transparent, and anyone can help build them – whether you want to contribute a few hours or a few months. Product ideas, vision and execution are driven by the community.


Each contribution you make will be rewarded with a fair amount of stake in the project (stake is distributed through App Coins). As soon as a product is generating revenue, everyone who helped build it receives payment each month. During development, Assembly often helps cover expenses like servers and web domains.


Working on Assembly projects is a great way to learn, challenge yourself and make a meaningful contribution to a great product. Also, if the products you help build are successful, you might earn substantial income.

title: What is the best way to get the feel for Assembly?
---

Hop into a discussion and introduce yourself! There are lots of products being actively built today, and everyone working on them is friendly. Talk about your interests and availability, and see if there are any tasks you’d like to work on. Helping build products is a rewarding, fun way to quickly gain an understanding of how Assembly works.

---
title: What parts of building can I help out with?
---

Anything and everything. Take a look at the tasks on a particular project and see if anything is of interest for you. Or, just introduce yourself to the team working on a project you like. No matter what your skills are, there’s someone on Assembly who needs them.


Registered Assembly members are free to participate in supporting and evolving any of Assembly's portfolio apps in the ways they see fit. Help out as little or as much as you want.

title: Why do people work on Assembly products?
---

Assembly is a community of makers, and people come here to build. Some are seeking a challenge and a chance to learn, while others are inspired by the collaborative environment. While Assembly apps offer a real opportunity to earn income, people also find the opportunity make cool products to be truly rewarding.

title: How is an app’s revenue distributed?
---

When anyone contributes to a product (whether by submitting code, copy or design), she will earn App Coins. Each product has its own App Coins, and anyone who owns them is entitled to portions of the app’s revenue.


Each month, after an app’s expenses are paid, the revenue will be distributed among everyone who contributed to it. If you own 10% of the App Coins for a product making $20,000/mo after expenses, you’ll earn $2,000/mo.

title: I have a great idea. Will the Assembly community build it for me?
---

Not exactly. Assembly is a place to build products collaboratively. If you are passionate about an idea and eager to play a key role in seeing it through, Assembly is a great place to do that. If you want to offer the idea and let someone else build it, you may find more success with contract developers and designers.


A key ingredient to success on Assembly is community support. There are many ways to get the community to rally behind your product, but the best approach we’ve seen is to join in on another project and start building a network of talented Assembly members. That way, when you launch your own project you’ll already have people in mind for your core team.

title: Who owns the intellectual property?
---

Assembly owns the intellectual property on behalf of our members, because that’s the best way to protect your interests.


Assembly enables each of our members to make a virtually limitless number of contributions to each app. As a result, each app may comprise hundreds or even thousands of different ideas and contributions, each with a different owner. Protecting the intellectual property rights of the hundreds of contributors to each app is virtually impossible if each contributor retains ownership of their contribution.


Thus, Assembly retains all intellectual property derived from Assembly apps on behalf of our members, in order to protect the interests of our members and to maximize the returns derived from the sale of the commercialized apps. However, Assembly also recognizes that our members should have the right to use their ideas in other contexts. As a result, we give our members a license back to their content to give them the flexibility to use their intellectual property in other ways, as long as is not for commercial purposes.

title: What does transparency mean to Assembly?
---

This is really important to us. When a product is built on Assembly, we believe an open, transparent process is key. That means anyone can see progress, discussions, ownership and even revenue.


Obviously, we can’t make the claim that building products in public is the best approach if we aren’t doing that ourselves. So, go check out [assemblymade.com/meta](https://assemblymade.com/meta). You can scan through our history of development and discussion, even seeing real-time updates as we ship new features.

title: How is Assembly different from Kickstarter or an Incubator?
---

VCs and Incubators invest capital in a traditional company in exchange for equity. The capital is used to accelerate app growth until there is a liquidity event (IPO or acquisition) where the investors and founders receive most of the reward. Assembly instead provides a platform and backbone services so that anyone, anywhere can work together to build great apps and share the rewards fairly.


Kickstarter is a great place for an existing team of friends or colleagues to validate and crowdfund the development of their ideas. Assembly similarly collects pre-sales at a huge discount on ideas to validate that people want them, but the money is then pooled and distributed fairly to everyone that contributes to making the app. Pre-sales on Assembly also come with a 100% money back guarantee so you never have to worry about backing an app that doesn't ship.
