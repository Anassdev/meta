title: What parts of building can I help out with?
---
Registered Assembly members are free to participate in supporting and evolving any of Assembly's portfolio apps in the ways they see fit. Help out as little or as much as you want.


---
title: Who's in control?
---
You are. Assembly apps are built by everyone, but like successful open source products every Assembly app also has a Core Team of contributors. The Core Team influences the vision of the app, standards for quality, and evaluates which contributions are accepted. It consists of the most active and respected contributors on the app. A new app's Core Team is typically made up of the inventor and Assembly staff members who are meant to be partners, advisors, and resources to the creative people around the world working on the app.  As development progresses, more contributors would comprise the core team, and Assembly staff members will typically only provide support services as needed.

---
title: How and where will the app be developed?
---
Each Assembly app's source code is released under a BSD 3-clause license, making it freely available for non-commercial use and development. However, Assembly retains an exclusive license to commercialize the app so we can award the proceeds back to the people who made it. The Assembly platform is intended to make it easy to view and search all discussions, comments, designs, and other contributions to a project. Assembly transparently shares an app's revenue, costs, and anonymized data including: number of users, MAU, page views, and other key metrics.

---
title: What technology is used to build Assembly apps?
---
An Assembly app's core technology is decided by the Core Team and early contributors when development is first started. We host components on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) when possible for the time being. This guarantees the code the community builds will have a [level of modularity](http://12factor.net/).

As other technologies like [docker](http://www.docker.io/) and [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) evolve so may our stack.

---
title: What happens when there are disagreements?
---
The Assembly platform is intended to allow everyone to participate in influencing the direction of an app. Assembly also actively surfaces key metrics so all decisions are data driven and can even be reevaluated and rolled back later when more data is available. In the event the community hasn't come to a clear direction and the data is inconclusive, the core team will be left to mediate disputes and decide on an outcome.

---
title: Who pays the operating costs before there is any revenue?
---
Assembly takes an app's monthly revenue and first pays operating costs incurred by the app (e.g. server costs, advertising, etc). Additionally if Assembly invested capital (e.g. server hosting) before there was revenue, then a portion of that debit may be paid back to Assembly at Assembly's sole discretion. All payments are fully disclosed to App Coin holders.


---
title: What if work needs to get done that nobody is doing?
---
If a necessary task goes uncompleted, Assembly may be able to help. We're equipped to handle design,  accounting, legal issues, PR, marketing and more. We also may cover the initial infrastructure and marketing costs, at our discretion. As an app begins earning revenue, we pay those costs from the profits and distribute the remaining proceeds back to the contributors.

Every app has an Assembly employee assigned as a liaison between Assembly and the rest of the community.

---
title: What happens if development stops on an app?
---
If an idea doesn't get and/or sustain support Assembly may decide to retire it. We'll notify the inventor and all the contributors.  Assembly will also change the source code license to the MIT license and all non-code contributed work will be released under the [Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/us/).

---
title: Is user data secure and private?
---
Although no one can guarantee 100% security on the Internet, we use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to protect an app's user data. Assembly apps and their data is hosted on Assembly's infrastructure, and access to this infrastructure is limited to a restricted group of Assembly staff.

An Assembly product will only launch when its data can be safely and securely stored for its' users in accordance with industry standard security measures. The Assembly community, however, is responsible for making contributions that anonymize data when necessary so the community can work on apps without compromising anyone's identity.


---
title: What if a company wants to acquire an Assembly product that I own app coins in?
---
Assembly may choose to sell a product if another party wishes to purchase it. In an acquisition, the proceeds from the purchase would be divided to all contributors according to how many app coins they have in the product. For example, if you own 2% of the total outstanding app coins and the product sells for US $5 million (after acquisition costs), you would receive US $100,000.

---
title: How does Assembly seek to prevent fraudulent activity?
---
Assembly cares deeply about creating a platform that is fair to all contributors. Assembly continuously monitors activity. If any account is determined to be manipulating the awarding of app coins, their account will be removed and their app coins will be reclaimed by Assembly. Assembly will use all legal means to recover previous distributions of revenue from the fraudulent account holder.
