title: How do I earn income from Assembly?
---
Every month a product generates revenue, the bill associated with it (server costs, advertising, capital investment repayments, and so forth) are paid transparently by Assembly. The remaining proceeds are split and distributed as royalties to those that built the product.

For example, if a product generated $10,000 in revenue during a month and cost $1,500 to operate including Assembly's 10%, then 100% of the remaining $8,500 would be distributed to the contributors.

Your monthly share of the royalty payout will depend on the percentage of the product's app coins you own. You can request a balance transfer of your Assembly income any time it exceeds US $100. Balance transfers are made through either PayPal or an ACH (checking account) payment for US residents. International contributors are paid using PayPal. Transfer fees may apply and are your responsibility.

title: How do I earn app coins?
---
App coins are primarily earned through your contributions (e.g. code, design, copy, etc) to the software products being built on Assembly. A contribution made to a product can be awarded app coins by the product's core team. Members may choose tip you for your contributions with their app coins too.

Here is a common example of how Mary might earn app coins in the Helpful product.


1. Patrick suggests a new task for building a feature for Helpful.

2. Community members upvote the task because they think it’s valuable to Helpful’s progress. This upvoting process adds app coins to the bounty that’s up for grabs for completing the task.

3. Mary jumps in on the task and submits work, completing the task.

4. The product’s Core Team then accept Mary’s work, which awards her the task’s bounty of app coins.

5. Later David comes along and likes Mary's work after it was already awarded. He also upvotes it and Mary earns additional app more coins because the work was already accepted by the Core Team.

Additionally, most products retain 5% of the app coins for the person that submitted the idea and anyone else they add to the Core Team to help them lead the product development.

title: What happens to my app coins if I stop working on an app?
---
Your app coins remain with you in perpetuity, even after you stop working on the products, as long as you remain an active member. Contributions by other community members will continue to earn them new app coins which would dilute your stake over time. New contributions that potentially dilute you should also be increasing product's value and in turn its revenue too. The could result in potentially a smaller share of the overall app coins but each app coin could more valuable.

To remain an active member of an Assembly app, you must keep your email information up to date and sign in to Assembly and vote on or make at least one new contribution for that app every calendar year.

title: How are app coins fairly rewarded to early contributors?
---
Each product has its own exchange rate for App Coins that is dynamic and adjusts depending on the duration of development, and its rate of progress. Early in development a product tends to have less people upvoting bounties then the more mature products.  Therefore, young products with small communities will see exchange rates where your 1 upvote might mint 90 or more app coins for the person that completes the work. Mature products with a large community will start to see that value go down as low as 1 upvote equaling 1 app coin earned.

title: How do annuities work?
---
Annuities are paid to founders who bring more established products to the platform. They are paid out of the product's profit, after any expenses. If the monthly profit drops below the annuities, they will only be paid up to the available profit and there would be no royalty payout to other contributors for that month.

title: How is Assembly different from a VC or incubator?
---
VCs and Incubators invest capital in a traditional company in exchange for equity. The capital is used to accelerate app growth until there is a liquidity event (IPO or acquisition) where the investors and founders receive most of the reward. Assembly instead provides a platform and backbone services so that anyone, anywhere can work together to build great apps and share the rewards fairly.

title: How is Assembly different from Kickstarter?
---
Kickstarter is a great place for an existing team of friends or colleagues to validate and crowd-fund the development of their ideas. Assembly similarly collects pre-sales at a huge discount on ideas to validate that people want them, but the money is then pooled and distributed fairly to everyone that contributes to making the app. Pre-sales on Assembly also come with a 100% money back guarantee so you never have to worry about backing an app that doesn't ship.
