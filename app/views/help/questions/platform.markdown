title: What does it mean to watch a product?
---

If you are watching a product, you’ll receive notifications (both on the web and occasionally via email) when people are discussing the product or creating new tasks and projects on it.

---
title: Can I create a task for a product if I’m not on the core team?
---

Yes. If you haven’t worked on the product much, it may be best to check in with the Core Team in chat and make sure priorities are aligned, but anyone can create a task.

---
title: How do I convey priority for a task?
---

Upvote it. Each upvote increases the number of App Coins assigned to a task, and also increases its visibility on the task list.
