title: What are perks?
---
Most ideas include perks that can be bought by early adopters at a discount. When someone buys an app idea's perk, the idea earns extra points and rises in the leaderboard.

title: When will my card be charged?
---
If you buy a perk, we simply validate and securely store (via our payment processor) your credit card information until the end of the month. If that idea wins, we'll let you know that we're charging your credit card for the perk. Remember, you're pre-buying the perk at a discount, so you get a better deal than those who buy it after the app is released.

title: What if the app doesn't ship?
---
Software development is a tricky business. Sometimes a perk doesn't make it into the first version and has to be delayed until later. If you get charged for a perk and it doesn't show up in the app within six months, you'll get a full refund.


Additionally, if an app ships and you're not happy with it, you have 30 days to request a full refund of any perks you bought.

title: What if I don't like the app once it ships?
---
If you pre-order an app and you are unhappy with the app when it finally ships, just let us know within 30 days and we'll refund 100% of your money.

---
title: What happens to the money collected for pre-orders?
---
All the money received for pre-purchased perks of an app go into its own account. This validates the demand for a product, awards early contributors, and ensure the app will launch. Only once the app ships do the funds begin to be released to contributors. 


The app's contributors with stake begin to receive 20% of the total collected pre-sells revenue each month, starting the second month after the perk's feature-set is built and launched. This allows for the 30-day grace period described in the Assembly refund policy. All revenue will be paid out by the end of a 6 month period after the initial launch date.
