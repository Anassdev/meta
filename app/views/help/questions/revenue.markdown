title: How do I earn income from Assembly?
---

Every month a product generates revenue, the bills associated with it (server costs, advertising, capital investment repayments, and so forth) are paid transparently by Assembly. The remaining proceeds are split and distributed as royalties to those that built the product. The ownership of a product is represented through App Coins.


Below is an example.


*A product, called XFoo, generated $10,000 in revenue in May, 2014. Operating costs during that month (including Assembly’s 10% stake) were $1,500. Then, the remaining $8,500 is distributed to everyone who contributed to the product. Your monthly share of the royalty payout will depend on the percentage of the product’s App Coins you own.*


You can request a balance transfer of your Assembly income any time it exceeds US 100.00 USD. Balance transfers are made through either PayPal or an ACH (checking account) payment for US residents. International contributors are paid using PayPal. Transfer fees may apply and are your responsibility.

title: How do I earn App Coins?
---

App Coins are primarily earned through your contributions (e.g. code, design, copy, etc) to the software products being built on Assembly. A contribution made to a product can be awarded App Coins by the product's Core Team. Members may also choose to tip you for your contributions with their App Coins.

Here is a common example of how Mary might earn App Coins in the Helpful product.


1. Patrick suggests a new task for building a feature for Helpful.

2. Community members upvote the task because they think it’s valuable to Helpful’s progress. Each upvote adds App Coins to the bounty for completing the task.

3. Mary jumps in on the task and submits work, completing the task.

4. The product’s Core Team then accept Mary’s work, which awards her the task’s bounty of App Coins.

5. Later David comes along and likes Mary's work after it was already awarded. He also upvotes it and Mary earns additional app more App Coins because the work was already accepted by the Core Team.

Additionally, most products retain 5% of the App Coins for the person who submitted the idea and anyone else they add to the Core Team to help them lead the product development.

title: What happens to my App Coins if I stop working on an app?
---

Your App Coins remain with you in perpetuity, even after you stop working on the products, as long as you remain an active member. Contributions by other community members will continue to earn them new App Coins which would dilute your stake over time. However, these contributions increase the value of the product, so you end up with a smaller slice of a larger pie.


To remain an active member of an Assembly app, you must keep your email information up to date and sign in to Assembly and vote on or make at least one new contribution for that app every calendar year.

title: How are App Coins fairly rewarded to early contributors?
---

Each product has its own exchange rate for App Coins that is dynamic and adjusts depending on the duration of development, and its rate of progress. Early in development a product tends to have fewer people upvoting bounties.


Therefore, young products with small communities will see exchange rates where your 1 upvote might mint 90 or more app coins for the person who completes the work. Mature products with a large community will start to see that value go down as low as 1 upvote equaling 1 App Coin earned.

title: Who pays the operating costs before there is any revenue?
---

Assembly will often help cover a great deal of these costs. We can’t promise to cover all costs in all cases, but if we see momentum and vision around an idea, we’re prepared to support you financially until the product ships and starts making money. In some cases, we may recoup some or all of that money when the product starts earning revenue.

---
title: Can an Assembly project be acquired by another company?
---

Yes. If offers are made to acquire an Assembly product, it will be up to the Core Team to decide whether or not to take it. In the case of an acquisition, all funds will be distributed among those who own the product’s App Coins after the acquisition expenses are paid.
