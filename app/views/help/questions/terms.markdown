title: App Coins
---

App Coins represent ownership of an Assembly product. Each product has its own set of coins, and each coin holds a certain percentage of ownership. App Coins can be earned by contributing to a project, and can also be “tipped” between users.

---
title: Core Team
---

Every Assembly app also has a Core Team of active, key contributors. The Core Team influences the vision of the app, standards for quality, and evaluates which contributions are accepted. [Learn more about the roles and responsibilities of a Core Team](https://assembly.com/core-team).

A contributor is anyone who helps build a product.

A project is a place within a product to group bounties, discuss priorities and track overall progress.

A bounty is a bit of work that needs to be done on a product. It could be code, design or copy. Each bounty has a number of App Coins assigned to it, which are awarded to the contributor who completes it.
