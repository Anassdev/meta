## Pitchweek

Pitchweek is an opportunity to rally the community behind your product, helping accelerate movement from idea to launch to revenue. Here's how to participate:

**Step 1:  Idea** 

Whether this is an idea you've submitted to Assembly in the past, or a brand new one, you'll want to be sure you clearly and concisely convey who you are and what  you want to build.

**Step 2: Video**

In order to enter Pitchweek, you need to create a video. This is your chance to show off your creativity and personality while demonstrating how great your idea is.

Here's an example of a great video:

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/102253176" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

*Tip: here are some important things to cover in your video: Who are you? What's your background? Why are you well-equipped to help this idea succeed? What is your idea? How is it better than current solutions? How will you reach your customers? What are your challenges? How far along are you? etc.*

**Step 3: Apply for Pitchweek**

As soon as you have refined your idea and submitted a video, you can click "Apply for Pitchweek" on the your product page. If your pitch includes clearly communicated ideas and a strong video, we will approve it for Pitchweek.

**Step 4: Community support**

Once you enter Pitchweek, you'll be featured on the Assembly Fresh Products page, where the community can rally behind your idea. In those seven days, if XX people sign up with bios to join your team, you'll become a featured Assembly product, and you can start development with a kick-off meeting.

Teams that go through Pitchweek will have the support of both the community and the Assembly team as they build their products.
