Product expenses are reimbursed from revenue once there is profit.

Using an open <a href="http://coins.assembly.com/whitepaper">Color Coins</a> protocol, we’ve decentralized the concept of ownership. Once your ownership is scribed in App Coins on the Bitcoin blockchain, it can’t be tampered with (not even by Assembly). Product App Coins are used to distribute the royalty income back to the people that made the product. This new technology may eventually even enable the exchange of your ownership in a free marketplace or exercising your voting rights.

                  Assembly collects a 10% platform fee of the revenue after expenses. This is initially used to cover basic operating costs until a product’s revenue exceeds costs. Any proceeds after expenses are distributed to coin holders based on their app coins percentages. You can see <a href='https://assembly.com/coderwall/financials'>Coderwall</a> as an example of a mature product paying out in this model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We care deeply that we’re creating more value for the community then the 10% collected as a platform fee. Building on Assembly not only connects you with others around the world, but you also can build products with the freedom of not having to hand initial capital to run the product, managing the finances, paying accounting and legal costs and all the other burdens of operating a traditional company. We’re also investing in continuing to find ways to create new value for the community as well as exploring ways to reduce fees if feasible.

                  Assembly collects a 10% platform fee of the revenue after expenses. This is initially used to cover basic operating costs until a product’s revenue exceeds costs. Any proceeds after expenses are distributed to coin holders based on their app coins percentages. You can see <a href='https://assembly.com/coderwall/financials'>Coderwall</a> as an example of a mature product paying out in this model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We care deeply that we’re creating more value for the community then the 10% collected as a platform fee. Building on Assembly not only connects you with others around the world, but you also can build products with the freedom of not having to hand initial capital to run the product, managing the finances, paying accounting and legal costs and all the other burdens of operating a traditional company. We’re also investing in continuing to find ways to create new value for the community as well as exploring ways to reduce fees if feasible.

                <p>We deliberately leave the roadmap up to each product’s Core Team. We urge and help products to outline clear ways to monetizing the product. You’ll find most products have these roadmaps in their discussions or plainly stated on their product pages.

                <p>
                  Sometimes a product solves a problem but it is unclear how it would make revenue today. These products can also be built on Assembly.

                <p>Yes, of course. We’ve worked hard to figure out the legal framework of letting people build businesses in this new way.</p>
                <p>Each product on Assembly is legally structured as a partnership, where all stakeholders are partners - sorta like how a law firm works. All the partners have access to the product’s information and influence over the direction. The product’s profits are paid out to partners as royalties, based on each partner’s App Coin ownership.</p>

                <p>In lots of cases, people are using bounties on Assembly for things that you might think you need to hire an employee for. For example, someone might put in 4 hours per week responding to support emails, and earn a flat number of App Coins for that work.</p>
                <p>Additionally, once your product is earning money you can spend it as you please – which might mean hiring contract employees.</p>

                <p>You actually get 100% at the start. The 500,000 App Coins we start you off with are 100% of the allocated coins at that point, but 5% of the available coins. As new ones are awarded, each coin will be worth a smaller percentage of the product.</p>
                <p>But, typically the person who submits the idea is highly active in planning and building it, so you will continue to earn App Coins throughout the process.</p>
