          Ready to jump in and contribute to a product? Find a task that resonates with your skill set and start working on it&mdash;permission isn't necessary. If you would rather help less mature products with their core features and strategy, check out the <a href="<%= explore_path %>">explore page</a>.
        </p> -->

        <p>You're now a part of a growing collective of like-minded folk who are coming together to breathe life into product ideas. Anyone can help out; just voting on a task you find interesting will help move a product forward. Ready to get involved? Find an idea that resonates with you, take a look at its progress, then start contributing. Permission isn't necessary.</p>

      <p>The Assembly Product Showcase is a daily leaderboard of up-and-coming products supported by the community; a group of builders and entrepreneurs ready to discover, share, and transform ideas into successful apps. Each weekday, five products are featured. Show interest in any of them by clicking 'Want'â€”this lets Assembly know to notify you when it ships. If you have skills to contribute, join the project's team and help out yourself!</p>
