        <p>
          <span class="bold">Community.</span>
          Assembly is a great place to coordinate your team, see what else is happening over the weekend. Tools like real-time chat, GitHub integration, and task management will make things seamless, so you can focus on building.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">Transparent ownership.</span>
          Did you know that some apps built at Startup Weekend have sold for millions of dollars? Assembly will help you distribute ownership fairly throughout the weekend and going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">The future.</span>
          If half your team wants to keep working after the weekend and half don't â€“ Assembly is a great way to reward everyone for their work so far and to connect you with great people to take this from a weekend hack to a high-growth business.
