Hi <%= @user.username %>,

We’re getting ready to launch a new campaign to rally the community behind some of the great ideas on Assembly, called Pitchweek. I saw you created <%= @product.name %> (<%= product_url(@product) %>), and would love to help you get some momentum behind it with Pitchweek.

To get involved, submit a pitch video. We’ll be showcasing them to the Assembly community as well as getting your product in front of over 100,000 talented developers and designers. it is a great new opportunity to help assemble a team that shares your vision and wants to help build <%= @product.name %>.

There are more details about Pitchweek here and a sample video at <%= pitch_week_url %>

Would you like to be included?

Best, Austin Smith
