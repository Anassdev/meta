Hi <%= @user.username %>,

I'm Austin from Assembly, I like <%= @product.name %>, and would love to help you get some momentum behind it.

Weâ€™re getting ready to launch a campaign to rally the community behind some of the great ideas on Assembly, called Pitchweek. The only requirement is a product video.

We'll showcase your video for a week, giving you a chance to help assemble a team that shares your vision and wants to help build <%= @product.name %>. We'll be promoting the showcase of videos to 100,000 talented developers and designers.

There are more details about Pitchweek here and a sample video at https://assembly.com/pitchweek

Would you like to get <%= @product.name %> involved?

Best,

Austin Smith
