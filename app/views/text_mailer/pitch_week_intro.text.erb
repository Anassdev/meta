Hi <%= @user.username %>,

Weâ€™re getting ready to launch a new campaign to rally the community behind some of the great ideas on Assembly, called Pitchweek. I saw you created <%= @product.name %> (<%= product_url(@product) %>), and would love to help you get some momentum behind it with Pitchweek.

The way it works is teams are submitting videos, and we're showcasing them to the Assembly community. This is a great opportunity to help assemble a team that shares your vision and wants to help build <%= @product.name %>. We'll be promoting the showcase of videos to over 100,000 talented developers and designers.

There are more details about Pitchweek here and a sample video at <%= pitch_week_url %>

Would you like to be included?

Best, Austin Smith
