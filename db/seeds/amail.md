# Imagine if you could fork GMail

This would be the wordpress equivalent of email. It should have an installer so anyone can easily setup and host their own instance for free on AWS or their own servers. For those that don't want to host their own instance, Assembly would offer an affordable hosted solutions so anyone, technical or not, could use it for their personal email.

It should include all the features everyone has learned to use in GMail like key-board shortcuts, archiving, labels, etc. The hosted version would be supported on a freemium model depending on how much storage you used on a monthly basis. It wouldn't serve ads and email could be encrypted on the server, keeping all my emails private.

Potentially businesses could use a hosted version of AMail or host their own version at no cost.
