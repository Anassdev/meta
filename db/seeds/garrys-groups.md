Garry's Groups is a super simple alternative to Google Groups for privately communicating with others. Send emails to a single address and have them  automatically forwarded out to everybody else in a group. As a member of the group you can unsubscribe from the emails at any time. You can also go online to search and read the history of all the emails sent on the list.

I personally could use this for a few groups that I'm a part of:

* The YC partners
* YC founders
* Posthaven developers
* My Burning Man camp

# How could Garry's Groups rise above the rest?

* Just being simple. Yahoo Groups takes 11 steps just to create an email list. They require categories, every list is public, and you need a Yahoo! account. Google groups requires 8 steps, way too many settings, and difficult to onboard new members.
* Friendly features like [Libre List's](http://librelist.com) style sign-up of sending an email.
* Fast archives and searching
* Configurable WebHooks for easy integration with other web apps

# How will it make money?

As with all Assembly products, the code itself will be only available for people to contribute to and host on their own servers. For the people who don't want to do that, there will be a hosted version. We could charge list admins a subscription tiered by:

* number of lists
* storage
* volume of emails
* number of subscribers
* use your own domain
* searchable attachments

The other groups interested in buying something like this would be enterprise customers. We build and distribute something for them like Github Enterprise.

The other interesting thing is that Basecamp charged a one-off fee for each list. Didn't sound like it worked out for 37signals but it's worth considering.
