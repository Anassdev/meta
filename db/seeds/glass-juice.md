Glass Juice would collect latitude & longitude coordinates for all the accessible power outlets in the US Domestic airport terminals. Asking Google Glass for a power outlet would send your coordinates to Glass Juice to retrieve directions to the nearest power outlets. Google Juice would then show an arrow (compass) in the heads up display directing you to the power outlet with its distance away in feet. The quality of the power outlet could be rated too, for example is it close to chairs or do I have to sit on the floor.

This could be made available as an iPhone and Android app too.

# Assembly's take on mapping all the airports

The hardest part would be mapping the power outlets across the country's airports. Assembly would award stake in revenue to anyone that maps out a terminal in an Airport. Mapping would be done by opening up the Andriod or iPhone app and walking along the walls, pressing a big button every time a power outlet was discovered. The mobile app would be able to send the coordinates to the Google Juice server. It would probably take only 20 mins or so to map an entire terminal.

# Making money

Assembly could charge a one-time purchase price between $9 USD and $19 USD. This would entitle the user to ask for power outlets in any Domestic airport mapped.

Another option would be partnering with terminal retailers and integrating location based ads/promotions when using the app. For example, "Come use the power outlets at Chili's in terminal B".
