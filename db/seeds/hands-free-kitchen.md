# How it works

Look through your personal cookbooks for something delicious to prepare. When you find a great recipe take a photo of it with your Hands Free Kitchen app. The photo could be sent to [Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) to be digitized. Once the recipe is prepared the user would be notified and then able to follow each step, presented through the Glass Display. The user would be able to go forwards or backwards through steps and even easily jump back to the ingredient list by asking Glass.

# How it could make money

The app could be sold on install when Google releases the anticipated [Glass App Store](http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/06/google-glass-boutique/). Another alternative would be to charge the user a small fee for each recipe they upload to their Google Glass. Down the road there could be ways to legally monetize the database of recipes that have been uploaded by app users and digitized by the Hands Free Kitchen app.
