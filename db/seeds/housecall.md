House visits by a repair handyman often cost a homeowner anywhere from $50 to $150 not including time and materials for fixing the problem. Many of these issues can be solved quickly by walking the homeowner through a few steps.

Housecall would save homeowners stress, uncertainty, time, and money by providing near-realtime access to a professional. Using the video on your iPhone or Android, the Housecall app would connect you with-in minutes to a Handyman that could help you troubleshoot issues with:
* Air Conditioning & Heating
* Plumbing
* Electric
* Appliances
* and more

# How it would work

1. Open the phone and select the type of Handyman you would like to connect with
2. Housecall tries to connect you with a professional in your area that also has the Housecall app
3. Once the available Handyman is found, your both connected over video
4. The Handyman can help you perform simple steps to see if there obvious problems that can be solved
5. If parts or extensive labor is required, the Handyman can give you a fair quote and an onsite visit can be arranged

# How it makes money

Each consultation could charge the homeowner a small fee (i.e. $20). Handyman could also pay to be featured and use Housecall as a novel leadgen source.

# Assembly's approach to the network challenges

Housecall has significant chicken/egg challenges. To be useful for Homeowners, there needs to be a supply of readily accessible Handyman (preferably located near the Homeowner). Handymen would also need a good supply of Homeowners for the service to be usable. To build this network across the country could be difficult and require alot of manual time but one possible strategy to grow scale the marketplace of Handymen could be:

1. Get a small group of 2 or 3 plumbers, electricians, etc to install Housecall. This would be some schlep work.
2. When a homeowner initiates a housecall, connect them with someone in this initial group of Handymen
3. If the consultation determines an onsite repair is required, Housecall would take the Homeowners location and search Yelp for local Handyman in there area
4. Housecall would have an automated phone system (using Twilio) that could call the Handyman inform them about the lead, the problem, and the Housecall website url where they can retype in their phone number, register, &o accept the project to get the address
5. After the onsite repair is successful, House call would upsell the new Handyman through SMS/Email/Etc to become an on-demand Housecall consultant.
6. Future homeowners in the area would be routed to the local Handyman first but fall back on available pool of Handymen if one is not in their area.
