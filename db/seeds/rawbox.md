You can learn about [the back story on my blog](http://paulstamatiou.com/storage-for-photographers)

RAWbox is a desktop app that would upload all your RAW photos to AWS Glacier for long-term commodity cloud storage. It would export tiny jpegs of each RAW to make it easy to identify which photos you have backed up. You could easily retrieve individual photo RAWs from the cloud or entire sets.

To backup your RAWs, you would drag photos to the RAWbox desktop application. Using your personal AWS credentials, RAWbox would upload all shots to Amazon Glacier by default. RAWbox would export small jpegs of all uploaded photos so you have local viewable versions to see which photos are backed up.

Upon a successful upload, RAWbox would delete the RAWs locally and lets you reclaim precious SSD gigs.
