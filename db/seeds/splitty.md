It's the end of dinner with a big group of friends, the check comes out and the chaos begins. Credit Cards are thrown on the table, cash is thrown into the mix, someone wants to pay for the extra drinks and it's up to you to sort out the mess!

Splitty is the solution.

Just pay the bill yourself and then use the Splitty iPhone app to quickly auto-split the bill with the table and collect everyones portion. If your friends don't have cash, you can do things like:

* Take a photo of their credit card and have their portion charged and deposited in your bank account.
* Add a friends email and setup auto reminders for them to pay you later with their credit card, cash, or paypal.

Individually everyone can pay the way they want to and Splitty will track everything. Quickly make adjustments for each person and then Splitty will handle charging everyone.

### APIs & SDKs for everyone

Besides Splitty being a consumer app anyone can use, the entire app will also be released as an iOS SDK so any mobile developer could integrate Splitty in their own apps and make it easy for friends & family to split purchases.

# How does it make money?

Every time a friend pays you with their credit card they'll be charged a $0.25 transaction fee that will be collected by Splitty (on top of other merchant fees, probably stripe).

Once Splitty gets sizable traction, it could partner with restaurants, bars, and other local businesses offering unique location-aware perks to Splitty users.
