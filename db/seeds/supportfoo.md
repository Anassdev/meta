At Woofu, the web-based support software services had two primary problems:

* They charge per seat, which gets costly if your who team helps out with support
* They all feel slow and bulky

SupportFoo's primary innovation is pricing. Instead of charging per-seat, we would charge by volume. This makes our service incredibly cheap for early stage startups. It also intrinsically encourage a company to get better at support to take advantage of better pricing.

A good support tool should get out of your way so you can respond to customer questions as quickly as possible. To help make it speedy SupportFoo would run in a native (MacOS) shell and possibly a web version like close.io. We should also tightly integrate with IMAP similar to how the MailboxApp creatively uses IMAP to manage state of emails. As example, assigning a support email to someone or postponing it for later state would just move them to different system-defined folders in IMAP.

Enterprises should be able to use and run behind their firewall.
