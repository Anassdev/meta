For example:
 1. I decide I want to quit smoking. I set that as my goal in Swear Jar and then each time I smoke, self-report (or family reports) a violation which deposits $1 into the "jar" via a linked payment source.
 2. Officemates decide that they're creating a "don't be late" Swear Jar and each time someone is late to a meeting, they have to contribute .50 to the Jar. Each month the person who has been late the least, collects the jar.

What you need:
 * Goal Setting: some structured, some free form fields (type, duration, penalty, etc)
 * Ability for one or more people to be attached to the goal as participants, or just observers who can force a participant to make deposit
 * Ability to link a payment source to Swear Jar per user
 * Ability to charge, or batch and hold charges until they hit a certain amount (to account for transaction costs)
 * Stats to show violations
 * Jars can be public or private. Public jars can be followed for updates.
 * Ability to deposit the Swear Jar into a linked account, donate to a charity, etc
